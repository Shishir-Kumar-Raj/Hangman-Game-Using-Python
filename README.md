# Hangman-Game-Using-Python

This Python script offers a basic version of the traditional word-guessing game, **Hangman**, with a focus on animal names. A random word is selected from a predefined list that includes animals like "lion," "tiger," "elephant," and others. The player's goal is to uncover the hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Initially, the word is hidden behind underscores (`_`), each representing an unguessed letter. When a correct letter is guessed, it is revealed in its appropriate position(s); if the guess is incorrect, the player loses one life, and a portion of a hangman figure—created with ASCII art—is displayed. The player is given six lives in total, and the game ends either when the entire word is guessed correctly or when all lives are used up. The code uses a list called `stages` to visually depict each stage of the hangman's construction. It also maintains a `display` list to show progress on the guessed word. The main game logic runs inside a loop, continually accepting input and updating the game state until the win or loss condition is met. This script emphasizes interactive gameplay with visual updates based on the player's performance.
